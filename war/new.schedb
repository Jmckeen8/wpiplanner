Numerous applications are presented to motivate coverage of fundamental  operating principles of circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, and  inductors; model the signals produced by these sensors; and analyze the circuits  and systems used to amplify and process these signals. After a review of  Kirchhoff ‘s current and voltage laws, fundamental analysis techniques such as  Thevenin and Norton’s theorems and the superposition principle are used to  model and analyze sensors, circuits, and systems. Concepts from analysis of  linear, time-invariant continuous-time signals and systems are introduced as  necessary, including Fourier series and characterization of systems such as filters  in both the frequency domain (bandwidth, transfer function) and time domain  (rise time, step response). Capacitance, inductance and mutual inductance are  explored as energy storage elements, including consideration of resonance and  energy losses in power systems. Concepts will be reinforced with the use of  laboratory exercises and computer simulation.  Recommended background: ECE 2010, MA 1024 (or equivalent),  PH 1120/21.

<course number="2029" name="INTRODUCTION TO DIGITAL CIRCUIT DESIGN" course_desc="Cat. I  Digital circuits are the foundation upon which the computers, cell phones, and calculators we use every day are built. This course explores these foundations by  using modern digital design techniques to design, implement and test digital  circuits ranging in complexity from basic logic gates to state machines that  perform useful functions like calculations, counting, timing, and a host of other  applications. Students will learn modern design techniques, using a hardware  description language (HDL) such as Verilog to design, simulate and implement  logic systems consisting of basic gates, adders, multiplexers, latches, and  counters. The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as  field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in  terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments  involving the design of combinational and sequential circuits will provide  students a hands-on introduction to basic digital electrical engineering concepts  and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students  will construct, troubleshoot, and test the digital circuits that they have developed  using a hardware description language. These custom logic designs will be  implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment.  Topics: Number representations, Boolean algebra, design and simplification of combinational circuits, arithmetic circuits, analysis and design of sequential  circuits, and synchronous state machines.

<course number="2049" name="EMBEDDED COMPUTING IN ENGINEERING DESIGN" course_desc="Cat. I  Embedded computers are literally everywhere in modern life. On any given day  we interact with and depend on dozens of small computers to make coffee, run  cell phones, take pictures, play music, control elevators, manage the  emissions and antilock brakes in our automobile, control a home security  system, and so on. Using popular everyday devices as case studies, students in  this course are introduced to the unique computing and design challenges posed  by embedded systems. Students will then solve real-world design problems using  small, resource constrained (time/memory/power) computing platforms. The hardware and software structure of modern embedded devices and basic interactions between embedded computers and the physical world will also be  covered in lecture and as part of laboratory experiments. In the laboratory,  emphasis is placed on interfacing embedded processors with common sensors  and devices (e.g. temperature sensors, keypads, LCD display, SPI ports, pulse  width modulated motor controller outputs) while developing the skills needed  to use embedded processors in systems design. This course is also appropriate for  RBE and other engineering and CS students interested in learning about  embedded system theory and design.  Topics: Number/data representations, embedded system design using C,  microprocessor and microcontroller architecture, program development and  debugging tools for a small target processor, hardware/software dependencies, use of memory mapped peripherals, design of event driven software, time and  resource management, applications case studies.  Lab Exercises: Students will solve commonly encountered embedded  processing problems to implement useful systems. Starting with a requirements  list students will use the knowledge gained during the lectures to implement  solutions to problems which explore topics such as user interfaces and  interfacing with the physical world, logic flow, and timing and time constrained  programming. Exercises will be performed on microcontroller and/or  microprocessor based embedded systems using cross platform development tools appropriate to the target platform.

<course number="2112" name="ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS" course_desc="Cat. I  The object of this course is a comprehensive treatment of electromagnetic engineering principles covering the entire application spectrum from static to  dynamic field phenomena. The starting point will be the basic electric and magnetic field definitions of Coulomb  and Biot-Savart leading to Gauss’s and Ampere’s laws. They form the foundation of electro- and magnetostatics fields. Students will examine capacitive and inductive  systems and relate them to lumped element circuit models. By introducing tempora l and spatial magnetic flux variations, Faraday’s law is established. The engineering  implications of this law are investigated in terms of transformer and motor actions.  Incorporation of the displacement current density into Ampere’s law and combining it  with Faraday’s law will then culminate in the complete set of Maxwell’s field equations.  As a result of these equations, students will develop the concept of wave propagation in  the time and frequency domain with practical applications such as wireless communication,  radar, Global Positioning Systems, and microwave circuits.

I  A beginning course in understanding the structures and properties of metals, ceramics and plastics, in the selection and in the working and heat treating of  materials. A course of interest to any engineer, scientist or person involved with  materials. The underlying fundamental theme of materials science is structure-property  relationship. Structures covered range from the subatomic, or nuclear level,  through the microscopic world to the macroscopic, or gross point of view.  Properties investigated may be chemical, mechanical, thermal, nuclear, electrical  or optical.

<course number="4411" name="SENIOR SEMINAR IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES" course_desc="Cat. I  This course is designed to integrate each student’s international courses, projects, and experiences in a capstone seminar in International Studies. Students will  reflect on what they have learned in their previous courses and international  experiences. They will assess what happened to them overseas, why it happened,  and how it might be understood.

<course number="1120" name="CALCULUS II (SEMESTER VERSION)" course_desc="Cat.I  The topics for integral calculus (MA 1022) are covered in this course: the  concept of the definite integral, the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,  integration techniques, and applications of integration. Applications include: area, volume, arc length, center of mass, work, force, and exponential growth  and decay. Logarithmic and exponential functions are studied in depth.  Arithmetic and geometric sequences and series will also be covered. Key historical events in the development of integral calculus are examined. Technology will be used as appropriate to support the material being studied.  This course extends for 14 weeks and offers 1/3 unit of credit. It is designed  for students who would benefit from additional contact hours and who need to  strengthen their mathematical background. Although the course will make use  of computers, no programming experience is assumed.

<course number="1971" name="BRIDGE TO HIGHER MATHEMATICS" course_desc="Cat.I The principal aim of this course is to introduce and enhance mathematical thinking. The course is intended not only for beginning mathematics, statistics or actuarial students, but also for students seeking to further their mathematical interests and those simply curious about logic and reason. Students in the course will be expected to explain, justify, defend, disprove, conjecture and verify mathematical ideas, both verbally and in writing. One expected by-product of this training is that students will develop concrete proof-writing skills which will improve their prospects for success in more advanced mathematics courses. When appropriate, course discussion will touch on current events in the mathematical sciences, including recently solved problems and open challenges facing today’s scientists.

<course number="2631" name="PROBABILITY" course_desc="Cat. I  The purpose of this course is twofold:  • To introduce the student to probability. Topics to be covered will be chosen  from: axiomatic development of probability; independence; Bayes theorem;  discrete and continuous random variables; expectation; special distributions  including the binomial and normal; moment generating functions; multivariate  distributions; conditional and marginal distributions; independence  of random variables; transformations of random variables; limit theorems.  • To introduce fundamental ideas and methods of mathematics using the  study of probability as the vehicle.

While much of the development in this field has been the result of recent efforts, the history of automatic mechanical instruments reaches back centuries.  We will consider this history by looking at past designs and listening to the music that has been composed using such instruments.  We will also survey modern machines, which have increasingly moved towards robotics with the integration of computer-based processing and sensing capabilities.  We will entertain technical and aesthetic questions relating to these systems and their musical output.  We will do all of this with our mind open to the question of how we can design new machines to make new kinds of music.

The goal is to provide fundamental preparation for any specialty application of thermodynamics. The material covered includes a general description of large number systems, states, canonical state variables, state functions, response functions, and equations of the state.  Focus will be given to the physical meanings of free-energies, enthalpy, chemical potential, and entropy.

How has the being of nature and knowledge of nature been represented in Western philosophy and science? Is knowledge objective? What constitutes adequate justification for holding a belief? Are different kinds of bodies treated as differently credible in terms of knowledge production? Is it even possible to know anything about the world at all? Metaphysics explores questions concerning the nature and structure of reality, such as: What is the self? Do souls exist? How important are categories such as gender, race, class, and sexuality in forming our identities? Does God exist? Is reality material, immaterial, or a combination of both? What is time? Am I the same person today that I was yesterday? What kind of a phenomenon is mind or thought and can entities in addition to human beings, such as computers, be said to have this attribute?

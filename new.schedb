This course explores these foundations by using modern digital design techniques to design, implement and test digital circuits ranging in complexity from basic logic gates to state machines that perform useful functions like calculations, counting, timing, and a host of other applications. Students will learn modern design techniques, using a hardware description language (HDL) such as Verilog to design, simulate and implement logic systems consisting of basic gates, adders, multiplexers, latches, and counters. The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments involving the design of combinational and sequential circuits will provide students a hands-on introduction to basic digital electrical engineering concepts and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students will construct, troubleshoot, and test the digital circuits that they have developed using a hardware description language. These custom logic designs will be implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment.

The function and operation of programmable logic devices, such as field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), will be described and discussed in terms of how an HDL logic design is mapped and implemented. Experiments involving the design of combinational and sequential circuits will provide students a hands-on introduction to basic digital electrical engineering concepts and the skills needed to gain more advanced skills. In the laboratory, students will construct, troubleshoot, and test the digital circuits that they have developed using a hardware description language. These custom logic designs will be implemented using FPGAs and validated using test equipment. Topics: Number representations, Boolean algebra, design and simplification of combinational circuits, arithmetic circuits, analysis and design of sequential circuits, and synchronous state machines. Lab exercises: Design, analysis and construction of combinational and sequential circuits; use of hardware description languages to implement, test, and verify digital circuits; function and operation of FPGAs.&#10;Recommended background: Introductory Electrical and Computer Engineering concepts covered in a course such as ECE 2010 or RBE 1001, and MA 1022.

I  Embedded computers are literally everywhere in modern life. On any given day we interact with and depend on dozens of small computers to make coffee, run cell phones, take pictures, play music play, control elevators, manage the emissions and antilock brakes in our automobile, control a home security system, and so on. Using popular everyday devices as case studies, students in this course are introduced to the unique computing and design challenges posed by embedded systems. Students will then solve real-world design problems using small, resource constrained (time/memory/power) computing platforms. The hardware and software structure of modern embedded devices and basic interactions between embedded computers and the physical world will also be covered in lecture and as part of laboratory experiments. In the laboratory, emphasis is placed on interfacing embedded processors with common sensors and devices (e.g. temperature sensors, keypads, LCD display, SPI ports, pulse width modulated motor controller outputs) while developing the skills needed to use embedded processors in systems design. This course is also appropriate for RBE and other engineering and CS students interested in learning about embedded system theory and design. Topics: Number/data representations, embedded system design using C, microprocessor and microcontroller architecture, program development and debugging tools for a small target processor, hardware/software dependencies, use of memory mapped peripherals, design of event driven software, time and resource management, applications case studies. Lab Exercises: Students will solve commonly encountered embedded processing problems to implement useful systems. Starting with a requirements list students will use the knowledge gained during the lectures to implement solutions to problems which explore topics such as user interfaces and interfacing with the physical world, logic flow, and timing and time constrained programming. Exercises will be performed on microcontroller and/or microprocessor based embedded systems using cross platform development tools appropriate to the target platform.

II  This course is a general introduction to the field of development economics. The focus is on ways in which a developing country can increase its productive capacity, both agricultural and industrial, in order to achieve sustained economic growth. The course proceeds by first examining how economic growth and economic development are measured and how the various nations of the world compare according to well-known social and economic indicators. Theories of economic growth and theories of economic development are then examined, as are the various social and cultural structures that are thought to influence economic progress. The inputs to economic growth and development (land, labor, capital, entrepreneurial ability, education, technical change), and the possible distributions of income and levels of employment that result from their use, is considered next. Domestic economic problems and policies such as development planning, the choice of sectorial policies, the choice of monetary and fiscal policies, rapid population growth, and urbanization and urban economic development are then examined. The course concludes with a consideration of international problems and policies such as import substitution and export promotion, foreign debt, foreign investment, and the role of international firms.

II  Environment and development are often seen as incompatible, in part because many poor people in the developing world depend directly on natural resources for their livelihoods. At the same time, poor people are often seen as responsible for causing environmental degradation because they lack the knowledge, skills and resources to manage the environment effectively. The vicious circle is completed as environmental degradation exacerbates poverty. However, optimists argue that poor people can and do contribute positively to environmental outcomes, that states and organizations can facilitate their efforts and that environmental interventions can coincide with development. This course will examine these different perspectives on environmental problems in the developing world through the insights and critiques of social science. Subjects covered include sustainable development, population, environmental risks, gender, urbanization, environmental decision making, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).

Systems Thinking provides tools that  enable program managers, systems engineers, scientists, economists, and business managers to  identify, understand, and control systems in order to improve system performance. The Systems  Thinking analysis accounts for feedback and resistance to change often exhibited by real world  systems. In this course, students will study system identification and delineation, causal loops  and feedback diagrams, stock-and-flow diagrams, system leverage points, delays and  oscillations, mental models and unintended consequences, and behavior patterns; and use these  concepts to improve the performance of engineering, business, and complex social systems. The  course will explore great system failures, how they might have been avoided, and how we can  learn from them. Finally, students will learn how Systems Thinking explains the occasional  irrational behavior of individuals, departments, businesses, and governments.

This course explores strengths, weaknesses, and challenges of different data gathering and analytic methods through exploration of prior studies, and considers how these research approaches intersect with social, cultural, and institutional practices and ethical standards. Students work in teams to develop proposals for a Graduate Qualifying Project that addresses the needs of an outside project partner.    Recommended background: Admission to the CCA MS program, completion of social science research methods course (e.g., ID2050 or equivalent), or permission of instructor.

IThe mathematical subject of linear programming deals with those problems in optimal resource allocation which can be modeled by a linear profit (or cost) function together with feasibility constraints expressible as linear inequalities. Such problems arise regularly in many industries, ranging from manufacturing to transportation, from the design of livestock diets to the construction of investment portfolios.This course considers the formulation of such real-world optimization problems as linear programming problems, the most important algorithms for their solution, and techniques for their analysis. The core material includes problem formulation, the primal and dual simplex algorithms, and duality theory. Further topics may include: sensitivity analysis; applications such as matrix games or network flow models; bounded variable linear programs; interior point methods.

IThe mathematical subject of linear programming deals with those problems in optimal resource allocation which can be modeled by a linear profit (or cost) function together with feasibility constraints expressible as linear inequalities. Such problems arise regularly in many industries, ranging from manufacturing to transportation, from the design of livestock diets to the construction of investment portfolios.This course considers the formulation of such real-world optimization problems as linear programming problems, the most important algorithms for their solution, and techniques for their analysis. The core material includes problem formulation, the primal and dual simplex algorithms, and duality theory. Further topics may include: sensitivity analysis; applications such as matrix games or network flow models; bounded variable linear programs; interior point methods.

The course emphasizes the application of basic laws of nature as they apply to differential elements which lead to differential equations that need to be solved; all of these ideas are used in higher level engineering science courses such as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, elasticity, etc. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the physical concepts in a problem, selecting appropriate differential elements, developing differential equations, and finding ways to solve these equations. Limitations on the mathematical solutions due to assumptions made will be considered. Recommended background: Ordinary Differential Equations (MA 2051), statics (ES 2501), dynamics (ES 2503). This course will be offered in 2020-21, and in alternating years thereafter.

Applications of axiomatic design are considered primarily, although not exclusively, for the design of manufacturing processes and tools. Axiomatic design is a design methodology based on the premise that there are two axioms that apply to all good designs. These axioms facilitate the teaching and practice of engineering design as a scientific discipline. Manufacturing process analysis is considered from the perspective of supporting design. Methods of analysis of manufacturing processes with broad applicability are sought. Special attention is given to examples in machining (traditional, nontraditional and grinding), additive manufacturing, and to the production of surfaces. The ability to find commonalities across applications and generalize is emphasized to facilitate further development of principles with broad applicability. The content is delivered in video lectures and in readings from the technical literature. Homework and quizzes are given and delivered online. There is a project to design a manufacturing process.

These areas include: the Army’s training management system, coordinating activities with staffs, and counseling skills. While the proficiency attained in each of these areas will initially be at the apprentice level, cadets will continue to sharpen these skills as they perform their roles as cadet officers in the ROTC battalion and as new lieutenants after commissioning.

Topics will include event distinction, temporal perception, hierarchical organization, perceptual grouping, expertise, memory and categorization . We will illustrate these ideas in musical contexts by listening to a variety of musical works . We will consider how psychological principles are applied to music technologies, such as compression algorithms, mixing methodologies and the field of music information retrieval . We will consider experiments that focus on some of these topics to further our understanding about how we experience music . Note: Students that received credit for MU 202X may not receive credit for MU 2501 . Students also may not receive credit for both MU 2501 and PSY 2501 . This course can count for either the HUA or the SSPS requirement, but it cannot double count for both the HUA and SSPS graduation requirements .

This course together with either SS1505 or SD1510 can provide the basic background for the students to use system dynamics in their IQP/MQP projects. Students will not be granted credit for both SD1520 and SD2520.   Recommended background: Fundamental systems thinking concepts as presented in SS1505, SD1510, or permission of the instructor.
